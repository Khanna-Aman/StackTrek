- [x] User state management (Redux)
- [x] Dashboard with progress overview
- [x] Responsive navigation
- [x] Theme system (light/dark mode)

### 🚧 **Partially Implemented:**
- [x] Profile page (placeholder ready for implementation)
- [x] Leaderboard page (placeholder ready for implementation)
- [ ] User progress persistence
- [ ] Achievement system
- [ ] Points/scoring system

### ❌ **Not Yet Implemented:**
- [ ] Mini-games
- [ ] Challenges system
- [ ] Detailed tutorials for all data structures
- [ ] Social features
- [ ] Advanced analytics

## 🔧 **Current Issues & Solutions**

### Issue 1: Demo Mode Button Appearing ✅ FIXED
**Problem**: Demo mode button shows even when user is authenticated
**Solution**: Updated logic to hide button when user is authenticated

### Issue 2: Firebase Not Configured ⚠️ NEEDS SETUP
**Problem**: Google/GitHub login won't work without Firebase
**Solution**: Created detailed setup guide in `firebase-setup.md`

### Issue 3: Missing Feature Implementation 📋 PLANNED
**Problem**: Profile, leaderboard, challenges, mini-games not implemented
**Solution**: Prioritized implementation plan below

## 🎯 **Next Implementation Priority**

### **Immediate (This Week)**
1. **User Profile Implementation**
   - User stats display
   - Progress visualization
   - Settings management
   - Avatar/profile picture

2. **Progress Persistence**
   - Save user progress to Firebase/localStorage
   - Track completed tutorials
   - Store user preferences

### **Short Term (Next 2 Weeks)**
3. **Leaderboard System**
   - Global rankings
   - Weekly/monthly leaderboards
   - Achievement badges
   - Social comparison

4. **Enhanced Tutorials**
   - Complete tutorial for each data structure
   - Interactive quizzes
   - Code challenges

### **Medium Term (Next Month)**
5. **Mini-Games**
   - Sorting algorithm races
   - Memory matching games
   - Speed challenges
   - Algorithm puzzles

6. **Challenges System**
   - Daily challenges
   - Progressive difficulty
   - Reward system
   - Community challenges

## 🛠️ **Technical Debt & Improvements**
- [ ] Add comprehensive error handling
- [ ] Implement loading states
- [ ] Add unit tests for components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Add accessibility features
- [ ] Implement offline mode

## 📊 **Current Feature Completeness**
- **Core Learning**: 95% ✅
- **User Experience**: 60% 🔄
- **Gamification**: 25% 🔄
- **Social Features**: 10% ❌
- **Advanced Features**: 5% ❌

## 🚀 **Quick Wins Available**
1. Implement basic user profile (2-3 hours)
2. Add progress persistence (1-2 hours)
3. Create simple leaderboard (3-4 hours)
4. Add more tutorial content (2-3 hours)
5. Implement basic achievement system (4-5 hours)

The app is already highly functional for learning data structures. The missing features are primarily gamification and social elements that enhance the experience but aren't critical for core functionality.

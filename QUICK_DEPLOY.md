3. Scroll to "Pages" section
4. Source: "GitHub Actions"
5. Create `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`:

```yaml
name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run build
      - uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./dist
```

## Test Your Deployment

### Before Deploying - Local Test
```bash
# Build and test locally first
npm run build
npm run preview
```

### After Deployment - Check These Features
1. **Navigation**: All pages load correctly
2. **Data Structures**: Interactive visualizations work
3. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile device
4. **Animations**: D3.js animations are smooth
5. **Theme Toggle**: Light/dark mode switching

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build Fails**: Check TypeScript errors with `npm run build`
- **Blank Page**: Check browser console for errors
- **Routing Issues**: Ensure redirects are configured (handled by `netlify.toml`)

### Environment Variables (If Needed)
For production deployment, you may want to set:
```
VITE_APP_TITLE="StackTrek - Interactive Data Structures"
NODE_ENV="production"
```

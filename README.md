# Gamify Data Structures

An interactive, gamified React application for learning data structures through visualization and hands-on practice.

## 🎯 Project Overview

This project aims to make learning data structures engaging and fun through:
- Interactive visualizations
- Gamification elements (XP, achievements, leaderboards)
- Step-by-step tutorials
- Hands-on challenges
- Community features

## 🚀 Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Setup ✅
- [x] React 18+ with TypeScript setup
- [x] Modern build tools (Vite)
- [x] State management (Redux Toolkit)
- [x] Routing (React Router v6)
- [x] Styling system (Styled Components)
- [x] Basic UI framework and layout
- [x] Development environment configuration

### Phase 2: Visualization Engine & Basic Data Structures ✅
- [x] D3.js visualization engine with SVG rendering
- [x] Interactive Array visualization with insert/delete/search
- [x] Linked List visualization with node-based operations
- [x] Stack visualization with LIFO operations
- [x] Queue visualization with FIFO operations
- [x] Animation controls and step-by-step operations
- [x] Code editor with syntax highlighting
- [x] Tutorial system framework

### Phase 3: Gamification & User Experience

# Literature Review
## Interactive Data Structures Education: A Comprehensive Analysis

###  Research Context

This literature review examines the intersection of educational technology, data structure pedagogy, and interactive visualization in computer science education. The review supports the development of StackTrek, an interactive learning platform for data structures education.

###  Research Questions Addressed

1. **How do interactive visualizations impact learning outcomes in computer science education?**
2. **What gamification strategies are most effective for maintaining student engagement?**
3. **How do modern web technologies enhance educational software development?**
4. **What accessibility considerations are crucial for inclusive CS education?**

###  Theoretical Framework

#### Constructivist Learning Theory
**Piaget (1977)** and **Vygotsky (1978)** established that learners construct knowledge through active engagement with their environment. This theory directly supports the interactive approach of StackTrek.

> *"Learning is an active process in which learners construct new ideas or concepts based upon their current/past knowledge."* - Bruner (1966)

#### Cognitive Load Theory
**Sweller (1988)** demonstrated that effective learning occurs when cognitive load is optimized. Interactive visualizations can reduce extraneous cognitive load while increasing germane cognitive load.

#### Dual Coding Theory
**Paivio (1986)** showed that information processed through both visual and verbal channels enhances learning retention, supporting the multimodal approach of data structure visualization.
